Overview
In this task, interns are required to migrate data between two databases (for example, from MySQL to PostgreSQL). The process includes analyzing the source database structure, creating an equivalent schema in the target database, transferring the data using scripts or tools, and validating that all records, constraints, and relationships remain intact after migration.
The task emphasizes understanding database schemas, data types, primary and foreign keys, and transaction handling. Interns must also document the entire migration process by submitting migration scripts along with a summary report explaining the steps followed, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.
Overall, Task 3 helps build practical skills in database management, data handling, and real-world system migration scenarios..

Key Activities
-Database Analysis
  -Study the source database structure
  -Identify tables, fields, data types, and constraints
-Schema Mapping
  -Map source database data types to target database equivalents
  -Design and create the target database schema
-Data Migration
  -Extract data from the source database
  -Transfer and load data into the target database using scripts or tools
-Data Integrity Validation
  -Verify record counts in both databases
  -Check primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints
  -Ensure no data loss or duplication
-Error Handling & Optimization
  -Handle migration errors and incompatibilities
  -Use transactions to ensure safe data transfer
-Documentation & Reporting
  -Prepare migration scripts
  -Write a summary report explaining the process, challenges, and outcomes

Key Insights
-Successful database migration requires thorough schema analysis to ensure compatibility between source and target databases.
-Data integrity is maintained by validating primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, and row counts after migration.
-Differences in data types and SQL syntax between MySQL and PostgreSQL must be carefully handled to avoid data loss.
-Using automation scripts significantly reduces manual errors and improves migration efficiency.
-Transaction management helps ensure consistency and allows safe rollback in case of failures.
-Pre-migration data cleaning improves migration accuracy and performance.
-Post-migration testing and verification are essential to confirm data completeness and correctness.
-Proper documentation makes the migration process reproducible and easier to maintain in the future.
